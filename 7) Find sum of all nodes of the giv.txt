7) Find sum of all nodes of the given perfect binary tree:

Assuming a perfect binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children:


def sum_of_nodes_perfect_binary_tree(root):
    if not root:
        return 0

    return root.val + 2 * sum_of_nodes_perfect_binary_tree(root.left)

# Example Usage:
perfect_tree_sum = sum_of_nodes_perfect_binary_tree(root)
print("Sum of nodes in a perfect binary tree:", perfect_tree_sum)
